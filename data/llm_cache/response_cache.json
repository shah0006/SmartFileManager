{"78f95a8cb2b80cea3210eade73c132f2": "However, training such deep networks is computationally expensive due to the large number of parameters and the need for large datasets. The current state-of-the-art algorithms [41, 42, 44, 47, 49] require a large amount of labeled data, which is often not available. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called \"residual learning\".\n    \n    Methodology\n    In this paper, we introduce a residual learning framework that is easy to train and has better generalization properties compared to previous methods. Our key idea is to explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth.\n    \n    Specifically, we reformulate the convolutional layers as residual functions, where the residual function is computed using the difference between the input and output of the corresponding layer. We define the residual function as the sum of the input and the output of the layer, and we use the gradient of the residual function with respect to the input and output to update the weights.\n    \n    We provide empirical evidence that our method improves the performance of the original network on various tasks, including ImageNet classification and CIFAR-10 classification.\n    \n    Results\n    We evaluate our method on the ImageNet classification task [36], where we compare our method with several state-of-the-art methods. We achieve 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.\n    \n    We also evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10 classification task [50], where we compare our method with several other methods. We obtain state-of-the-art results, achieving 93.7% accuracy on the validation set.\n    \n    Discussion\n    Our method is simple and easy to implement. It does not require any additional hyperparameters, and it can be easily adapted to different architectures.\n    \n    Limitations\n    One limitation of our method is that it requires a large amount of labeled data. Another limitation is that it may not work well for certain types of networks, such as those with multiple layers.", "e3e74436e5964765f9142e8b2ab0b7dd": "The text material is protected by copyright laws and may not be reproduced,\n    republished or distributed without prior written permission.
